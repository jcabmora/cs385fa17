#. You have a great idea for a software service, and you are lucky enough to have your own capital that will allow you to build a datacenter large enough to support the projected load for the next ten years, and pay and keep happy the engineers that are needed to support it. Furthermore, the financial projections establish that you will recover your datacenter investment in only 5 years (you can assume both projections are very accurate). The service is expected to be used mostly at the very early hours of the day, and the service will only be available in the US and Canada.  Would you build the datacenter, use cloud based services, or a mix of both?  Explain why.
