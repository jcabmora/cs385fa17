General Course Information
==========================

:Schedule:
    Fri 9\:00 AM to 11\:40 AM @ Darwin 38 / Stevenson 1034.
:Prerequisites: 
    CS 315, or consent of the instructor.


Course Description
==================
Lecture and Laboratory, 2:40 hours per week.

Students will learn fundamental concepts required to design and implement cloud-based systems.
Topics such as virtualization, scalability, partitioning, continuous integration, and microservices will be discussed in class and learned through practical lab exercises and case studies.

Course Format
=============
The course will be taught following a mixture of lectures, demonstration, and self-directed, skill-building exercises.
Assigned short readings and exercises will provide context and foundational knowledge for the class.


Course Goals and Student Learning Objectives
============================================

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to: 

* Design, build, test, deploy and manage scalable systems
* Identify trade-offs of different system architectures 
* Implement performance metrics on complex systems
* Apply caching, partitioning, messaging, and virtualizaton to solve scalability problems


Prerequisites
=============

Fluency in Unix and shell scripts is expected and will be extremely useful for this class.  Ability write programs in at least one high-level programming languages (such as Python, Ruby, C++, Java or Go) will be needed to be able to complete the programming assignments.

Textbook
========

No textbook is required for this class. Individual reading material will be assigned during each lecture.


Systems Access
==============

For this class you will need access to:

* ``blue.cs.sonoma.edu``. If you have not obtained this access, please make sure you reach out to Roger Mamer (roger.mamer@sonoma.edu -  Office next to Darwin 25) to have your account set up.
* Google Cloud Platform.  We have obtained educational credits to be able to use Google Cloud for this class.  Instructions to apply this credit will be provided in class.  If you prefer to use another service such as AWS, DigitalOcean, Azure or Heroku, you are welcome to use them as well (however, you will need to cover the cost). 

Course Schedule
===============

The schedule is subject to change, with fair notice via Moodle.

Classroom Protocol
==================
Moodle will be used to maintain grades, syllabus, schedule, assignments and class resources.
Moodle always holds the most current and authoritative set of due dates, exam dates, assignment instructions and other course material.
Course announcements will be done on Moodle, so you should check it frequently and adjust your notification settings as appropriate.
Moodle is the place where you will find the course syllabus, read posted announcements in the news forum, participate in online class discussions with classmates, submit your assignments online and view the materials for this course. 
To access the Moodle course use your SSU Seawolf ID and password to log into SSU's Online Services Portal https://login.sonoma.edu. 
Click on the Moodle link. 
When you get to the Moodle site home, click on the “My Courses” menu located on the top navigation. 
Click on the link for this course (classes are listed by course name and number). 
Note: The Login link is also conveniently located at the top of the Sonoma State University homepage http://www.sonoma.edu and many other university pages.

Quizzes
-------

In-class quizzes will be given almost every lecture, and they will cover the assigned readings and the topics discussed in class.
The two lowest grades will not count towards the final grade.

Midterm and Final Exams
-----------------------
A midterm and a final exam will be given during the semester. These will consist of both theory and practical (programming) questions.

During the test you will have access to a computer and you will be allowed to use the internet; however, you should not use this resource to ask others for help (Refer to the collaboration section below).
You can also bring books or written notes. 

Absolutely no cell phone usage will be permitted during tests.

If you have an emergency or need to make a phone call during an exam, let the instructor know before taking or making the call.
Use of any chat software/application will be strictly forbidden during tests.

Labs
----

Aproximately 6 Labs will be assigned during the semester. Students are encouraged to work in groups of up to three students.
Time to work on the labs will be allocated every week, and students are expected to complete the labs as homework. Labs will span several sessions, therefore students will have more than one week to complete them.

Students will be asked to provide a submission for each lab. Submissions will consist of a combination of one or more of the following:

* a writen a report
* source code and/or executable binaries
* the provisioning of a service that can be tested by the class instructor.

Your labs will be evaluated in terms of:

* **Correctness**: The answer does not contain errors and addresses the problem or question that you are asked to solve.
* **Efficiency**: The problem is solved with the least amount of resources (which includes both human and computating resources).

Project
-------

As a project, you will be asked to build a service using Cloud infrastructure. Students are encouraged to work in teams of up to three members.
The details of the project will be given to you within the first 4 weeks, so you will have plenty of time to work on your project.
In the week before the final you will present your project and you will demonstrate its functionality.
You will be allowed 20 minutes for your presentation.

In your presentation you should at least cover:

1) Description of the components
2) Design challenges and decisions
3) A demonstration of the tool/service that you provisioned
4) Metrics and scale demonstration

Regrade policy
==============
Regrade requests will be accepted up to 7 days after an assignment is returned.
The reason for the regrade request must be explained in writing and submitted as a hard copy along with the assignment to be regraded

Late policy
===========
You may deliver an assignment at later time, but for every 24 hours a 10% of the assignment's grade will be deducted.


Collaboration policy
====================
During tests and quizzes absolutely no collaboration is allowed, unless the instructor explicitly states the contrary. 
This includes shoulder surfing, peeking at other people’s screens, using Unix utilities to communicate with remote users, IRC or any other chat software, etc.
All normal, real-world materials will be available to you (Internet, man pages, etc) during tests.

You are encouraged to work on the project in groups of 2-3 students, however, if you prefer to work individually, you may do so.

During the labs, you are encouraged to discuss ideas and approaches with other students and the course staff.  Collaboration during labs 
You are encouraged to check your work through discussion with other students.
When encountering significant technical problems, you are encouraged to help peers and seek help from your peers during and outside lab. 
The following actions, however, will be penalized as academic dishonesty:

* Looking at another student’s work, digital files or screen without their permission.
* Letting someone else ‘drive’ your keyboard or ‘driving’ someone else’s keyboard, i.e., passing a keyboard over to let someone type it for you. There is always a simple solution: just grab a piece of whiteboard, write it out and talk about it away from the computer.
* Copying part or all of another person’s solution or any solutions that have not been provided by the instructor.

Students should be familiar with the University’s Cheating and Plagiarism policy http://www.sonoma.edu/UAffairs/policies/cheating_plagiarism.htm. 
Your own commitment to learning, as evidenced by your enrollment at Sonoma State University and the University’s policy, require you to be honest in all your academic course work. 
Instances of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. 
Cheating on exams or plagiarism (presenting the work of another as your own, or the use of another person’s ideas without giving proper credit) will result in a failing grade and sanctions by the University.
